Our policy is to respond to any notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). If we receive a notice or otherwise have reason to believe that content you submitted infringes another party's copyright, your account may be terminated and the video removed from TubeFlash.

<br><br>A: Make sure you have cookies enabled.
<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: What are 'tags'?</span>
<br><br>A: Tags are basically keywords that describe your videos.  Like, if you have a surfing video, you might choose to tag it with 'surfing,' 'water' and 'waves.'  Other users that enjoy watching surfing videos can then search for 'surfing' and your video will pop up in their search results.

        <span class="highlight">Q: How do I report copyright infringement?</span>
<br><br>A: If you believe that someone else has uploaded your copyrighted content without your permission, we encourage you to contact that person in order to resolve any differences with them directly.  You can also contact our support team using this <a href="contact.php">form</a> for instructions on how to submit a copyright infringement notice to TubeFlash.
<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: What if I have been falsely accused of copyright infringement?</span>
<br><br>A: We'll let you know if we receive a copyright complaint about any of your video content that is hosted on TubeFlash. We'll give you the opportunity to respond appropriately.
<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: What are you doing to prevent content that violates your policies from appearing in TubeFlash?</span>
<br><br>A: We do a preliminary review on uploaded videos through both a manual and automated process. Although we try our best to detect and remove videos that violate our policy guidelines, our review process is primarily focused on removing adult content or obvious copyright violations, and is not bulletproof. However, we encourage our viewers to notify us when they discover policy violations or copyright issues -- we have a process for reviewing reported policy violations, and respond to reported copyright violations under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: What is this .MSWMM file? How do I create a movie with Windows Movie Maker?</span>
<br><br>A: A .MSWMM file is a Windows Movie Maker Project file. By saving the project, it allows you to return to the movide and make modifications at a later time. However, if you're satisfied with the movie and would like to upload and share the result through FrameBit, you will need to choose the "Save Movie File" option under the "File" menu (which is different from "Save Project" that creates the .MSWMM file).
